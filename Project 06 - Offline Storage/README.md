This app serves as a diary entry app that allows the user to type diary entry with offline storage functionality

### Demo
![demo](https://github.com/shawnpanda/2016-Summer-Of-React-Native/blob/master/Project%2006%20-%20Offline%20Storage/demo.gif)


### Library Used
* redux
* react-native-router-flux
* react-redux
* redux-logger
* redux-persist
* remote-redux-devtools
* moment

### What I have learned

* Reviewing redux setup, which was similar to the project 1 with add/edit functionality
* Using redux-persist for react native asyncStorage
* Flexbox Layout
* Playing with the API of react-native-router-flux
* Setting up auto-expanding TextInput
* Placing a hidden Text to retrieve the initial height for the TextInput

### Unsolved Problem

- remote-redux-devtools didn't work

### Todo

- Adds auto-ordering according to dates
- Disable edits for past entries
- Allows only one entry per day
