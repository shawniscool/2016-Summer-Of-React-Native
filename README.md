# 2016-Summer-Of-React-Native

This project was inspired by [Sam Lu](https://twitter.com/samvlu)'s [100 Days of Swift](http://samvlu.com/index.html) and Allen Wong's [30 Days of Swift](https://github.com/allenwong/30DaysofSwift). After learning about their daily dedication to improve their programming skill, I decided to devote the summer of 2016 in learning react native.

This is a collection of self-taught projects and I have learned tremendously about different facets of react native, including managing state, router and unit tests. Each project contains its own README and describes the tools and lessons learnt.
